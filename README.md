# Linguistic-Map-Making
This repository contains a guide for making linguistic maps using freeware. It is written by a linguist for other linguists.

Ewdards Map making guide.pdf is the file to start with.
The screenshots referred to in this guide are in Inkshape screenshots.pdf and QGIS screenshots.pdf.

The guide refers to a number of accompanying files, which can be found in the AccompanyingFiles_... zip folders.
Due to limitations on the size of files that can be uploaded to GitHub, these accompaying files had to be
separated into different zip folders.
In particular, the guide frequently refers to "Countries.shp" --- which is a shapefile of countries of the world.
However, this file was too big to be uploaded, so I split it into three files:
 - Indonesia
 - Eurasia
 - AfricaAmerica
If you are following the guide sequentially (to make a map of the languages of Timor Island)
then the file to use instead of Countries.shp is Indonesia.shp.
