# Linguistic-Map-Making
Guide for producing linguistic maps

These documents contains a work-flow, or set of instructions,
for creating publication ready maps of languages using free, open-source software.
They should provide you with the basic skills needed to make and customise your own linguistic maps.
These documents do not consider in any detail the principles of cartography,
why linguists may want to make maps, ethical considerations in making maps,
nor how to gather linguistic geographic data.
See Gawne and Ring (2016) for a discussion of such topics,
in particular page 196â€“197 on ethical considerations.
The present guide is written for those who know what
linguistic data/information they want to represent on a map.
This guide assumes only a basic level of computer literacy,
and you certainly do not need to have any skills in
programming to follow this guide.
I myself currently have no programming skills.

To get started with this guide, download "Edwards Map making guide.pdf"
The screenshots referred to in this guide are in "Inkshape screenshots.pdf" and "QGIS screenshots.pdf".
The guide refers to a number of accompanying files, which can be found in the AccompanyingFiles_... zip folders.
Due to limitations on the size of files that can be uploaded to GitHub, these accompaying files had to be
separated into different zip folders.
In particular, the guide frequently refers to "Countries.shp" --- which is a shapefile of countries of the world.
However, this file was too big to be uploaded, so I split it into three files:
 - Indonesia
 - Eurasia
 - AfricaAmerica

If you are following the guide sequentially (to make a map of the languages of Timor Island)
then the file to use instead of Countries.shp is Indonesia.shp.

I would like to acknowledge a number of people who have contributed to this guide.
Firstly, those who were at the ANU CartoGIS Unit during my PhD studies:
Jenny Sheehan, Karina Pelling, and Kay Dancey.
The ANU CartoGIS Unit provided some preliminary training in editing maps in Adobe Illustrator
as well as many sound map making principles.
Secondly, I want to thank Kwang-Ju Cho, my office-mate during the course of my PhD.
Kwang-Ju got me started with QGIS and helped me solve many QGIS problems.
Thirdly, I would like to thank Marian Klamer who invited me to Leiden University as a guest researcher
at the beginning of 2017 where I first ran a workshop on map-making and wrote the first version of this guide.
Finally, I would like to thank Antoinette Schapper who invited me
to provide some map-making training to her project in March 2022
and thus gave me the impetus to revise this guide.

After revising the guide in March 2022 I approached Language Documentation and Conservation to see
if they would be interested in publishing the guide, in principle they were interested, but they
wnated me to revise it to make it less "bare bones". Fair enough. But that is not something that
I've ever since had the time or motivation to do. Enough people have approached me since then
asking how to make maps that it seems worth putting this out there in an accessible place.

If you have any questions, or want any shapefiles, feel free to ask me.
If you've found this guide useful, I encourage you to share this guide further.
